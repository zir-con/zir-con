        <p> They are the only dolphins in NZ with a rounded black dorsal fin their bodies are a distinctive grey, with white and black markings and a short snout. They live up to 20 years old.

            Like other dolphins, Hector’s use echolocation to find their food. They send out high frequency ‘clicks’ that bounce off surrounding objects and fish, giving the dolphins a detailed picture of their surroundings. This sonar is not used all the time, which may be one of the reasons why the dolphins get caught in nets.</p>
